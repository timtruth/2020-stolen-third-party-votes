# 2020-stolen-third-party-votes

Data source: New York Times website
For example, New York data from here: https://static01.nyt.com/elections-assets/2020/data/api/2020-11-03/race-page/new-york/president.json
(change the state in URL to get to other states)

I wrote a java script called NYT3rdPartySteal.java

And a .txt is also uploaded into this repo with the results


UPDATE: This might be in part due to imprecise percentages reported. 0.05% can be a lot of votes when the total is in the millions
